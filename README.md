Mancala AI Project

=====

The game itself has been (mostly) finished and debugged.

Matt and Kyle, you're player 2. Put all your code for your player AI into the Player2 class (I'll add one in a second).

=====

Things that still need implementing (put your name next to a task if you want to do it):

Looping the game 1000 times (Josh)

Adding a getCounters method in the Board class that takes an integer for the board position and returns the number of
counters in that space as an integer ()

Adding java doc ()
